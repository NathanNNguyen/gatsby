Instruction:
1. Clean the meat: Add all meat to a stock pot and enough water to submerge it, bring to a boil. Drain and rinse thoroughly under running water.
2. Add the meat, broth, lemongrass and onions to the pot and fill with water almost to the brim. Bring to a boil then drop the heat to medium-high to maintain a low boil. Add the seasoning.
3. Let it simmer and periodically check the meats for doneness and remove them as they finish cooking. The pork should be done after about an hour, the beef can vary between 2-3 hours.
4. After all the meat has removed, let it cool, then slice it. Adjust seasoning and add water to the broth pot if necessary.
5. Make the aromatics & coloring then add it to the pot.
