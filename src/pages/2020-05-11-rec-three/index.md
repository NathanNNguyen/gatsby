Instruction:
1. Slice the uncooked pork thinly, about 1/8". It helps to slightly freeze it beforehand.
2. Mince garlic and shallots. Mix in a bowl with sugar, fish sauce, thick soy sauce, pepper, and oil until sugar dissolves.
3. Marinate the meat for 1 hour, or overnight for better results.
4. Bake the pork at 375 F for 10-15 minutes or until about 80% cooked. Finish cooking by broiling in the oven until a nice golden brown color develops, flipping the pieces midway. Don't take your eyes off the broiler!
5. Assemble your bowl with veggies, noodles, and garnish. Many like to mix the whole bowl up and pour the fish sauce on top, but I like to make individual bites and sauce it slowly.
