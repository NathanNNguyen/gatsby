1. Generously salt fish and rinse under water to clean it. Set aside to dry.
1. Add oil to a pan and saute garlic over medium heat until lightly browned.
1. Layer onion on top, then the fish, evenly spaced.
1. Add the seasoning & cooking liquid (& chiles) and turn the heat to high until boiling. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning.

1. Gently flip the filets of fish over and simmer for a final ~10 minutes with the lid partially covered.
1. Stand there to watch it the final ~10 minutes to prevent it from burning! During this time you can continually spoon the sauce over the fish.
